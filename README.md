Random quote machine

By I. Mahle

A project of Free Code Camp: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine

Instructions

1. Run npm install
2. Run npx webpack
3. Open dist/index.html with a browser.

Discussion
I used the following technologies: HTML, CSS with SCSS and Bootstrap, Javascript with Jquery. This app is setup with webpack and makes an AJAX-request to an external API to receive the quotes. The quotes can be retweeted by Twitter.

A live version can be seen at https://codepen.io/IngaMM/full/OarYKb

Requirements
npm, browser
