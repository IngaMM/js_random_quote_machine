Random quote machine

By I. Mahle

A project of Free Code Camp: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine

Instructions

1. Run npm install
2. Run npx webpack
3. Open dist/index.html with a browser.

Discussion
I used the following technologies: Javascript, HTML, CSS.

This app shows a motivating quote that it gets from an external API by an AJAX-request. Clicking the button shows a new quote. The quote can be retweeted by Twitter. jQuery and SASS are used and a little bit of Bootstrap for styling.

Requirements
npm, browser
